                What metrics did you use to measure the successful launch of your product?
            </h1>
            <h2>Wednesday, July 15, 2020</h2>
            <p>
                I'm using today's question to provide a little "insider baseball" and to practice thinking through my presentation of this project as a learning experience on my road to becoming a product manager. Since I don't have any official product management experience, and therefore very little experience with some of the common tools and data platforms PMs use, I built <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a> to act as a laboratory for learning a little bit more about everything. In addition to inviting you to send me any question responses you come up with, I'd love to hear your "customer path" for how you ended up on <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a>.
            </p>
<h3>My response</h3>
<p>
When I launched PM Interview Question, I measured metrics from the web application itself and the social platforms where I initially promoted the product. As a product, while I consider the web app to be the bread and butter of what I've built, the real "sale" is acquiring newsletter subscribers. Since this is all just for personal educational purposes there is no financial incentive one way or the other. But, the most valuable users to me are those who want to engage with the newsletter and who will also send me some feedback on these daily answers.
</p><p>
For the website, I added Google Analytics and collected information on user session times and source of origin. I've also promoted the project on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Hacker News. Each social platform provides some of its own metrics which are very interesting when considering the reach those platforms provide. However, the ultimate goal is to see those social metrics convert into user acquisitions within the Google Analytics metrics and then as newsletter subscribers.
</p><p>
During the past month, 46% of visitors entered the site through my single LinkedIn post, 32% entered through my Hacker News post, and 20% entered through one of the daily Tweets I've posted so far. The LinkedIn post has received about 1000 "impressions" and the Tweets have collectively received about 3000 "impressions." This provides a pretty interesting contrast in terms of impressions-to-visits between those two platforms. In terms of return on investment, the LinkedIn post clearly provided the most attention followed by Hacker News. However, LinkedIn provided the least amount of conversions to newsletter subscribers. I attribute this to the fact that most of my connections and colleagues were interested in the project but are not necessarily in my target audience demographic (aspiring or current product managers). Hacker News and Twitter, on the other hand, provide a platform that generally contains a self-selected population of that segment.
</p><p>
Finally, daily usage of the app has dropped by about 75% since the first week of its release, however there has been gradual growth of newsletter subscribers. This indicates to me that, while many of the original audience has not returned or committed to the product, those who have returned are engaging with the newsletter at the same rate as during the big launch week.
            </p><p>
Some takeaways from what I've learned so far is that I will continue to experiment with the app itself. At the moment, the link to subscribe to the newsletter is below the fold. My initial thought process was to keep the initial experience as clean and distraction-free as possible. But, I may experiment with moving that link above the fold. I have also started to post some of the newsletters onto a blog at https://blog.pminterviewquestion.com. I'm not posting every day's newsletters but I do think there is some value in building up some material to potentially drive some search traffic.
