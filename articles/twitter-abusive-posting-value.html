            <h1>
                How would you determine the negative
                value of an abusive posting on Twitter?
            </h1>
            <h2>Wednesday, July 8, 2020</h2>
            <p>
                Managing abuse at scale on a platform like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube is extremely difficult. These
                platforms grew in popularity because they made it easily for billions of people to share anything they
                want. However, these platforms do not have a mechanism to guarantee that abusive content does not end up
                on the platforms as well. Most of these big platforms claim their machine learning/AI capabilities will
                solve this, but I believe it is going to be one of the biggest issues with the internet that our
                generation has to solve. Or, if it's unsolvable, should these huge "commons" types of spaces exist in
                the first place?
            </p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                Abusive postings on Twitter have will have a negative effect on the platform as a whole in three ways:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Users who do not abuse the platform will be less willing to engage and more likely to find an
                    alternative.</li>
                <li>Abusive postings encourage abusive replies and copycat behavior.</li>
                <li>Abusive postings will cause advertisers to reduce or end their promotions on the platform to prevent
                    being associated with abusive content.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In order to determine the negative value, I would use the metrics of a few Twitter features:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I would track how
                    many times a Tweet identifier is associated with the Mute and Block functions. This will allow us to
                    see
                    whether the post is driving users to take a proactive step to hide the Tweet.</li>
                <li>The Report message itself would be handled by the team investigating those claims however it is
                    still
                    important to track the frequency of Report initiations. Similar to Mute and Block actions, this will
                    indicate overall reader sentiment.</li>
                <li>Replies should also have all of the above metrics tracks. Dog-piling can occur when an abusive Tweet
                    generates abusive replies or a contentious dialog beyond non-abusive conversation. If a given thread
                    begins to show a high number of Mutes, Blocks, and Reports, it has a higher chance of being abusive
                    or
                    bordering on abusive.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Tracking the common functions like Mute/Block/Report should be pretty standard. I think the more
                interesting insights would be gained by focusing on detecting dog-piling as it is escalating and
                mitigating it by either removing the offending Tweet or by excluding it from users' Timelines.
