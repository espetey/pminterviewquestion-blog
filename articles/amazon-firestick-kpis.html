                What KPIs would you use to measure success for the Amazon Fire Stick?
            </h1>
            <h2>Monday, July 6, 2020</h2>
            <p>
                I have been finding this type of question more interesting to work on because it gives me a chance to
                consider different combinations of companies and their products. Remember that even if you are
                interviewing at one company, you may be asked about a different company's product. So I'm going to try
                to practice considering different companies, products, and business models because they will all have
                their own unique customers and KPIs/OKRs.</p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                I believe the business goals of Amazon's Fire Stick are (by order of importance): to increase revenue
                from content purchases and subscriptions to the Amazon Prime Video platform; to increase revenue from
                AWS subscriptions by app developers; to increase customer interactions with the Alexa voice platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reaching the first goal would involve selling subscriptions to Amazon Prime Video and selling and
                renting movie and TV shows. It can achieve this by placing advertisements for related Amazon content
                near other content the user has interacted with, whether that is Amazon-based or non-Amazon. To achieve
                the goal of increasing revenue from app developing partners, Amazon will need to ensure its AWS platform
                is reliable and that apps are fairly displayed. To achieve the goal to increase Alexa usage and draw
                customers into that ecosystem, Amazon must make the Alexa user experience well-integrated with the video
                and TV platform. This may involve developing new Alexa skills to take advantage of new types of user
                interactions that are not possible on the audio-only platforms like the Echo and Dot.</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                In order to measure whether we're reaching our first goal, I would monitor:</p>
                <li>The number of daily movie and TV rentals and purchases on the Fire Stick platform broken by Amazon
                    Prime subscribers and non-subscribers.</li>
                <li>The same metric from above except for web browser platforms and iOS/Android apps.</li>
                <li>The number of repeat views of previously purchased content; Are customers only purchasing a few
                    items and watching them over and over versus discovering new content?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In order to measure success of the second goal, I would monitor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The number of Fire Stick applications available to end users.</li>
                <li>The number of applications which have begun the registration and release process but which are not
                    yet available; This will provide insight into the amount of friction, cold feet about publishing, or
                    adjacent technical issues.</li>
                <li>The number of Fire Stick application related questions, tutorials, and repositories on platforms
                    like StackOverflow and GitHub; This will provide insight into whether developers are experiencing
                    friction with the development process and whether developers are evangelizing the Fire Stick
                    platform.</li>
            </ul>
            To measure the third goal, I would monitor:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of voice queries across all Fire Sticks.</li>
                <li>Number of voice queries relative to number of interactions via the remote.</li>
                <li>Number of voice queries relative to queries on other Alexa platforms (Echo, Dot, Auto).</li>
                <li>Number of queries from owners of other Alexa platforms relative to non-owners.</li>
                <li>Number of Alexa skills developed with descriptions or tags specific to Fire Stick integration.</li>
            </ul>
