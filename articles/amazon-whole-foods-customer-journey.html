            <h1>
                Develop Amazon's customer journey map when buying groceries online from Whole Foods.
            </h1>
            <h2>Friday, July 3, 2020</h2>
            <p>Today's question was an opportunity to use the "5Es Framework" discussed by Lewis Lin in The Product
                Manager Interview: Entice, Enter, Engage, Exit, and Extend. If you are not familiar with Lin's work I
                highly recommend his books or simply following him on LinkedIn or Twitter. In the case of Amazon and
                Whole Foods, it's interesting to think about how purchases made in one context could inform data
                analytics in the other. I'd be interested to know if you think this would be creepy or a step too far in
                the "recommendations" space. For example, if you had an Amazon Prime points credit card, would you be
                comfortable with Amazon pulling data from each of your grocery store purchases, whether they were at
                Whole Foods or another retailer?
            </p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                The customer journey map I would develop for a customer purchasing groceries from Whole Foods using
                Amazon's web platform would consist of the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                Entice: To attract customers to the offering, Amazon would prioritize Whole Foods shopping on its
                landing page for users who match the targeted segment, such as parents who purchase household staples,
                like toilet paper, napkins, and paper towels, using Amazon Prime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enter: Upon beginning their shopping experience, the user would then see suggested groceries. If they
                have shopped online for groceries before or if they have shopped at Whole Foods with an Amazon Prime
                credit card, "purchase again" options would be available. Grocery recommendations would be a mix of
                practical options and some impulsive and spontaneous options that may bring joy the customer's
                experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engage: Users would have the option to add items to their cart, save items to custom grocery lists, and
                view similar products and complementary products commonly purchased with the viewed items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exit: The customer would receive notifications throughout the lifecycle of their groceries being picked
                at the store; When the picker begins, if there are any substitutes that need to be made, and when the
                order is complete and ready to be picked up. After picking up their groceries, customers would be asked
                to take a short survey to provide feedback on their experience in exchange for a small discount on a
                future grocery purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Extend: Publish personalized email newsletters on a weekly basis, delivered the day or two before the
                customer tends to make their grocery purchases. This "newsletter" would be mostly machine generated
                recommendations and complementary items, as well as any regular purchases that may be on sale or out of
                stock.</p>
