            <h1>
                You are the PM of Facebook 3rd Party
                Login, and you see your numbers are declining 2% each week. What do you do?
            </h1>
            <h2>Friday, July 10, 2020</h2>
            <p>I'm following the trend of doing a question that comes off as
                company-specific at first but should be a little more generalizable after a little brainstorming. In
                this case, while it would help to know the ins and outs of Facebook's specific product, I would start
                from first principles around software development: new code, bugs, and network performance. Knowing how
                to begin tracking those issues down doesn't require a lot of Facebook-specific knowledge and can help to
                check off a lot of boxes. The scenario that a new competitor has begun stealing our customers is always
                a possibility but will take a little more external research, while code/bugs/network should be
                discoverable with a few calls to the devops, engineering, and QA teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                If usage numbers were declining 2% each week, I would first consider what the cause is. I would start
                with three possibilities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Our service level has degraded to the point where users are dropping off
                <li>Our product has a bug in the workflow that is preventing successful logins</li>
                <li>A competitor has entered the space</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I would assess whether there is a service or network issue first, as this would generally be a data
                gathering mission and would be a quick way to rule out anything that could potentially be fixed with a
                call to the devops team. To do so, I would gather recent network performance metrics, such as average
                network response times and failed requests, and compare them with the same metrics from previous weeks
                and months. I would be looking for any trends to suggest that performance had been decreasing leading up
                to this point. I would also look for anomalies in the performance that might suggest performance issues
                that may have been rising and falling prior to our discovery of a 2% decline in usage.</p>
            <p>My second question would be whether there is a bug in the workflow that is preventing successful logins.
                Investigating this would involve a few things. First I would look into the specific traffic that has
                decreased: Have we lost only iOS users? Or only users in one region? This could help isolate whether a
                bug was introduced into a specific code stream, such as a web- or mobile-focused API. It could also help
                identify if the decrease was related to an A/B test that had been recently performed. I would also work
                with an engineer to look at recent code commits to learn if anything was pushed in a similar timeframe
                as the decline's beginning. Second, I would talk to the QA team to learn if they've noticed anything
                that has changed with quality of the service.</p>
            <p>After feeling relatively certain it is not related to any internal issues, I would begin to do some
                market research to learn if there have been any new entrants into the 3rd-party login space or if a
                known competitor has recently released a significant upgrade or feature set. I would also take to social
                media and programming channels like Stack Overflow to learn if developers are discussing problems with
                Facebook's offering or if a competitor is being discussed more than they had in the past.</p>
