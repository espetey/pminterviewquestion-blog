                Find a water bottle. You have one? Great. Tell me how you would improve it.
            </h1>
            <h2>Wednesday, July 1, 2020</h2>
            <p>Today's question comes from a tweet threat by Kaz Nejatian (<a
                    href="https://twitter.com/CanadaKaz/status/1279062633489010688"
                    target="_blank">https://twitter.com/CanadaKaz/status/1279062633489010688</a>). The gist of the
                thread is that this question is useful in detecting whether the interviewee is interested in the variety
                of possible customers the product could be improved for. This is now one of the frameworks in my little
                tool belt that I need to make sure I always keep in mind. As I continue to practice for PM interview
                questions, one thing I think is good to internalize is to intuitively reach for a framework or
                structuring method before answering a question. No matter how obvious or innocuous, having some thought
                process shows that, for higher stakes questions, you're able to pause and reflect. This also plays into
                something I read along the lines of, Product Managers are most valuable when they help others come to a
                decision. So, in a way it is the PMs job to help find all possible options and make sure all users are
                represented. After that, the engineering, sales, marketing, finance, etc. departments will get to have
                their say as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I've got a cheap disposable bottle of water from the convenience store here, first I'd like to
                ask, who should we be improving the water bottle for? If we are improving it for people who drink from
                the water bottle, I would make it more easily collapsible and reusable. During my time trail running in
                Colorado, I learned that a lot of people use inexpensive plastic water bottles rather than fancier
                options because they can be crushed down to a small size, stored, and refilled later in the run. Doing
                this would increase the total value realized by the user. If we are improving it for the buyer of the
                bottle, I would make the bottle rectangular to provide the greatest amount of water possible given the
                storage limitations. This would give buyers the impression that they were getting their money's worth. I
                would use this same improvement for those managing the logistics and storage of the water bottles.
                Similar to the design of shipping containers, square water bottles would allow carriers and delivery
                drivers, for example, to deliver more total revenue of water in the equivalent transportation load.
            </p>
            <p>
                For people who sell water bottles, I would add more graphic design to the bottle's exterior. Many
                substitutes for bottled water now exist: sparkling water, soda, juice, energy drinks, alcohol. For the
                purchasing demographic that simply walks up to the cooler and chooses the lowest price water, the
                exterior will make little difference. But, for the person who enters the store undecided about what
                drink they will choose, an exciting design or one which appeals to a highly active persona, similar to
                energy drinks, may be effective in convincing customers to choose water over one of the non-water or
                non-sparkling substitutes. Lastly, if this were being improved for the manufacturer of water bottles, I
                would switch from using plastic entirely to using something biodegradable and sourceable from recycled
                materials, like a lightweight recycled cardboard that could be lined on the inside with a waterproof
                seal. This would allow the manufacturer to participate in the increasingly important green economy and
                to divest from less environmentally friendly plastic products. This would hopefully also decrease
                manufacturing costs as source materials could be less expensive given their recycled nature and could be
                less hazardous given the health implications of working in a factory that melts down plastics.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we were to pick from any of these potential users, I would suggest favoring the adoption of a square
                or rectangular water bottle. In addition to the direct benefits for purchasers perceiving more value and
                for the distributors transporting more per shipment, this form factor would be an interesting marketing
                opportunity to differentiate from other products on shelves.</p>
