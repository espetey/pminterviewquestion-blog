                What is the key to a good user interface?
            </h1>
            <h2>Monday, June 29, 2020</h2>
            <p>
                Today's question is one I have to catch myself from blurting out a gut reaction when asked. I've spent
                most of my career as a UI engineer for web and mobile so, of course, I have some strong opinions. But,
                this is a great opportunity to pause after hearing a question, organize my thoughts, and frame my
                response in a way that is less reactionary and a little more structured. Sometimes it is actually easier
                to remember to take time for this structuring on a difficult question where you actually may need a
                pause to collect your thoughts.
            </p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                The key to a good user interface is a combination of three things: simplicity, obvious actions, and low
                impact to failure. Simplicity is critical and actually involves a few different components. Simple means
                there isn't too much color, ambiguous design elements, or fancy JavaScript interactions. As a life-long
                JavaScript-er, I broke each of those rules quite a few times. But, I have learned that simple design is
                much easier for people of all backgrounds to understand and interact with. This is key to building
                accessible products that can be used by people with disabilities. Some developers see accessibility
                requirements as a limiting constraint. But, I believe it pushes design to achieve exactly what the
                product intends to solve and nothing more--avoiding all the superfluous bells and whistles of flashy
                design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, obvious actions builds on "simplicity" but goes even further to limit the actions we design into
                any one screen and make each of those actions significant. In other words, are they there for a reason?
                Twitter is one example of a UI/UX which has limited the possible actions on many screens and is
                generally a really simple app to use. More recently, I've been using the "Hey" email application. The
                level of obviousness on each screen is wonderful and limited to the most important action items on any
                given screen. The email composition screen, especially, gets points from me. It has "Send", "Save
                Draft", "Attach", "Font", and "Delete Draft" buttons. Gmail, on the other hand, has at least ten buttons
                directly related to the email, and the "Send" button has an exposing "More" arrow button to schedule the
                email for later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last is low impact to failure. If the user messes up, make sure they can refresh or hit the "Back"
                button and return to their previous state. So often, UI's or servers glitch out and the user ends up in
                a bad place and it's not their fault. Or, WiFi/data signal drops. Or, something about the UI or UX was
                confusing and they clicked a button they didn't mean to. These events should not cause someone to lose
                any data or progress on their work. The best apps and interactive websites now autosave constantly. This
                adds some technical overhead as there will need to be a server listening for updates, saving those to a
                database, and retaining the users' session. But when something does go wrong, it could make the
                difference between a user staying with your product for life and the user leaving your product and
                talking trash about it on the way out.
            </p>

                I'm interested to know what other people think makes a good user interface. I'm pretty open to
                suggestions on all of these but the issue of accessibility is one that I probably won't compromise on.
                There are many types of disabilities which may not be obvious (i.e. it's not just about designing
                websites for the blind). There is also lots of data to support that accessible websites and apps are
                more usable for those without disabilities as well (largely due to the necessary simplification). If
                you're interested in reading more about accessibility, a good place to start is the a11y (read: "ally")
