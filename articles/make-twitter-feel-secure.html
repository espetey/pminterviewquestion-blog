                How do you make the Twitter user experience feel more secure after last week's hack?
            </h1>
            <h2>Monday, July 20, 2020</h2>
            <p>
                I just want to preface this answer with the statement that I believe Twitter handled the hacking
                situation last week very well, at least from my non-blue-badge perspective. All the official Twitter
                accounts lit up with notifications and post-mortem-style tweet threads. Jack was Tweeting as well and
                even had a Tweet of solidarity, "Tough day for us at Twitter. We all feel terrible this happened." At
                any rate, security is hard and at scale I don't know if any digital platform is invulnerable. The best
                thing to do, in my opinion, is over communicate and show your users you're doing something about it.
            </p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                To make the user experience feel more secure, I would take four actions beyond Twitter's public
                communications from the official Twitter accounts and Jack Dorsey's account. These actions would
                implicitly or explicitly communicate that Twitter is proactive about security and that Twitter has taken
                steps to increase its communication. In a situation like this, even if the hack was isolated to a small
                number of accounts, many users may feel more comfortable with some tangible or visible change that
                increases their "feeling" or perception of security.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I would create a permanent "Twitter health" type of component on the #Explore/Search screen. This
                would be a small component using some sort of traffic light indicator (red/yellow/green light, with some
                accompanying iconography). One thing many API providers have is a similar "status" screen which shows
                their different servers and regions and whether those are experiencing issues. Similarly, Twitter should
                have something that can be used to indicate a range of statuses, from security situations to network
                disturbances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, I would measure if a user is logging on for the first time in a predetermined amount of time,
                for example two weeks or more. The idea here is that the user may be reacting to the news and is signing
                in to check whether they've been hacked. If the user falls into this segment, we could ask them to
                re-establish their login session, communicating that proactive measures were taken to secure their
                account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, I would use this as an opportunity to display a recommendation to users who do not have
                multi-factor authentication setup to do so. This could even be paired with a suggestion to update
                passwords or a reminder that different passwords should be used for different services and websites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fourth, I would consider using Twitter's Notifications channel to communicate with users who have been
                ruled out as being potentially compromised. This system is regularly used for security messaging, such
                as "There was a login to your account @pm_interview from a new device on Jul 20, 2020. Review it now."
                While I'm sure Twitter was in communication with account holders who were hacked (especially considering
                they were all or mostly blue-badge users), many users were likely unsure of their exposure and may not
                know what, if any, next steps they should take.</p>
