            <h1>
                How do you think we came up with the price of $99/year for Hey email?
            </h1>
            <h2>Friday, July 17, 2020</h2>
            <p>Today's question gets into a little bit of estimation. As I build out the data sheet at
                <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a>, I'll probably include a few
                blocks of common industry pricing structures. So,
                email, cloud storage, etc., would be included there so you can get a good idea of generally what those
                look like. Hopefully, unless you're applying in such an industry, they'd be relatively forgiving if you
                didn't have competitor pricing memorized.
            </p>
            <h3>My response</h3>
            <p>
                I think Hey analyzed a few things to come up with their $99/year pricing strategy. First, I believe they
                looked at what it would cost to host and serve a single customer in a cloud environment. This would set
                the floor for what they would need to price to make the business viable. An email account is essentially
                a file storage account where most files are text-based with some attachments. For many people, it is
                customary to store emails indefinitely. Hey works around this by "providing" auto-delete after a certain
                period of time which helps keep the data requirements for any one customer low. A company like FastMail
                provides a data cap, similar to Dropbox. FastMail's lowest tier is $36/year for 2GB of space.
                Interestingly, Dropbox is $120/year for 2TB of space and it provides, at a very high level, very similar
                services as an email provider. While this should not an apples to apples comparison, from a purely
                data-based comparison Dropbox offers rates of $0.06/GB/year, Hey offers $0.99/GB/year, and FastMail
                offers a whopping $18/GB/year. While Dropbox is at the low-end, I think it's safe to say they still
                provide some of the most robust, technically sound applications and infrastructure in the industry. So,
                pricing likely has little to do with pure technical costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, I think Hey looked at all the other business costs involved with each customer such as support,
                engineering, customer acquisition costs, and customer development costs (developing relationships with
                existing customers who are at risk of abandoning their account). It appears that Hey is targeting
                organic word-of-mouth growth for the initial stage of Hey's life. Jason Fried, the CEO, has made the
                rounds on nearly every tech podcast and also earned a lot of free press when the app conflicted with
                Apple's App Store policy. Support and engineering costs, however, can get large quickly. If Hey had
                1,000 customers, their revenue would be $99,000. And, it would certainly cost more than $99,000 to
                employ a few each of support and engineering staff to support those 1,000 customers. At $99, they are
                likely aiming for at least 10,000 customers to make revenue reach $1 million and make their business
                achieve critical scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, I think Hey looked at its competitors and priced itself at the high-end of consumer email. As
                stated earlier, FastMail offers consumer-level email between $36 and $60 per year and offers a number of
                features such as hosting email accounts from your own domain. GSuite provides the entire family of
                Google products including Gmail (also hosted against a domain). Only when you get into business email do
                prices exceed $100. So, I believe Hey is positioning itself as the highest quality consumer-grade email
                provider, second only to business-class email which is naturally expected to have similar privacy
                features Hey advertises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I think Hey considered what it would need to make to earn a healthy profit to continue the
                business without needing to raise money. Jason Fried, CEO of Hey, is very outspoken about the desire at
                Hey and at Basecamp to avoid venture capital or dreams of a huge IPO. From that perspective, the goal
                may have been to price Hey high enough to get a certain threshold of users that are price insensitive
                enough to pay for the service. But that threshold must eliminate more demanding, price sensitive
                customers who would consume greater support and customer development resources.
