                <h2>Friday, July 10, 2020</h2>
                <p>I'm following the trend of doing a question that comes off as
                    company-specific at first but should be a little more generalizable after a little brainstorming. In
                    this case, while it would help to know the ins and outs of Facebook's specific product, I would
                    start
                    from first principles around software development: new code, bugs, and network performance. Knowing
                    how
                    to begin tracking those issues down doesn't require a lot of Facebook-specific knowledge and can
                    help to
                    check off a lot of boxes. The scenario that a new competitor has begun stealing our customers is
                    always
                    a possibility but will take a little more external research, while code/bugs/network should be
                    discoverable with a few calls to the devops, engineering, and QA teams.</p>

                <p>Managing abuse at scale on a platform like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube is extremely difficult.
                    These platforms grew in popularity because they made it easily for billions of people to share
                    anything they want. However, these platforms do not have a mechanism to guarantee that abusive
                    content does not end up on the platforms as well. Most of these big platforms claim their machine
                    learning/AI capabilities will solve this, but I believe it is going to be one of the biggest issues
                    with the internet that our generation has to solve. Or, if it's unsolvable, should these huge
                    "commons" types of spaces exist in the first place?</p>
