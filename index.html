                <h2>Wednesday, July 15, 2020</h2>
                <p>I'm using today's question to provide a little "insider baseball" and to practice thinking through my presentation of this project as a learning experience on my road to becoming a product manager. Since I don't have any official product management experience, and therefore very little experience with some of the common tools and data platforms PMs use, I built <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a> to act as a laboratory for learning a little bit more about everything. In addition to inviting you to send me any question responses you come up with, I'd love to hear your "customer path" for how you ended up on <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a>.</p>

                <h2>Monday, July 13, 2020</h2>
                <p>Today's question is about localization--the practice of creating interchangeable strings of text that can be inserted into a user interface for any given user region. For example, since eBay was originally built in the United States, there's a good chance all the text (buttons, descriptions, etc.) were written in English. As eBay moved into new global markets, these text strings would be replaced with variables that would map to a series of language-specific values. There are many programming and script-based technologies to help with localization however when deploying an entirely new language small implementation details may be forgotten or fat-fingered. Localization can be challenging because it deals with the cultural differences between the developer's country of origin and the customer's culture and language. In other words, pulling out a Spanish-English dictionary will likely miss a lot of linguistic nuance and may result in verbiage that is entirely incorrect. Balancing the potential for the traffic reduction mentioned in the question, therefore, should address both the technical aspects of localization as well as the language and cultural aspects.</p>

                <h2>Friday, July 10, 2020</h2>
                <p>I'm following the trend of doing a question that comes off as
                    company-specific at first but should be a little more generalizable after a little brainstorming. In
                    this case, while it would help to know the ins and outs of Facebook's specific product, I would
                    start
                    from first principles around software development: new code, bugs, and network performance. Knowing
                    how
                    to begin tracking those issues down doesn't require a lot of Facebook-specific knowledge and can
                    help to
                    check off a lot of boxes. The scenario that a new competitor has begun stealing our customers is
                    always
                    a possibility but will take a little more external research, while code/bugs/network should be
                    discoverable with a few calls to the devops, engineering, and QA teams.</p>
