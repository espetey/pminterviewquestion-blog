                    <a href="./articles/make-twitter-feel-secure.html">How do you make the Twitter user experience feel
                        more secure after last week's hack?</a>
                </h1>
                <h2>Monday, July 20, 2020</h2>
                <p>I just want to preface this answer with the statement that I believe Twitter handled the hacking
                    situation last week very well, at least from my non-blue-badge perspective. All the official Twitter
                    accounts lit up with notifications and post-mortem-style tweet threads. Jack was Tweeting as well
                    and
                    even had a Tweet of solidarity, "Tough day for us at Twitter. We all feel terrible this happened."
                    At
                    any rate, security is hard and at scale I don't know if any digital platform is invulnerable. The
                    best
                    thing to do, in my opinion, is over communicate and show your users you're doing something about it.

                <h2>Friday, July 17, 2020</h2>
                <p>Today's question gets into a little bit of estimation. As I build out the data sheet at
                    <a href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a>, I'll probably include a few
                    blocks of common industry pricing structures.
                    So, email, cloud storage, etc., would be included there so you can get a good idea of generally what
                    those look like. Hopefully, unless you're applying in such an industry, they'd be relatively
                    forgiving if you didn't have competitor pricing memorized.</p>

                <p>I'm using today's question to provide a little "insider baseball" and to practice thinking through my
                    presentation of this project as a learning experience on my road to becoming a product manager.
                    Since I don't have any official product management experience, and therefore very little experience
                    with some of the common tools and data platforms PMs use, I built <a
                        href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a> to act as a laboratory for
                    learning a little bit more about everything. In addition to inviting you to send me any question
                    responses you come up with, I'd love to hear your "customer path" for how you ended up on <a
                        href="https://pminterviewquestion.com">pminterviewquestion.com</a>.</p>
